To cut down on processing time and memory requirements, we have reduced the dimensionality of the features from 4096 to 512; these features can be found in the files `train2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5` and `val2014_vgg16_fc7_pca.h5`.\n",

In addition, since we want to train with minibatches containing captions of different lengths, we pad short captions with a special `<NULL>` token after the `<END>` token and don't compute loss or gradient for `<NULL>` tokens.
